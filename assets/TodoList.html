<!--

  For compatibility with TodoMVC conventions the following does not follow
  Octopi conventions.

  Used for compatiblity with todomvc-common, but...
    - html5 tags should not be used
    - ids should not be used
    - style should not dependent on browser style
    - a class should be used for setting display: none or some other visibility
    - clear completed should should show a pointer cursor, so should delete, 
    check for todos and check all; or all, active, complete should not show the 
    pointer.
    - "X items left" should show text select or everything else that's not an 
    input should not show text select (ie. title, footer, etc)
    - style should not dependent on scripting (ie. main should not need to be
    hidden; an empty main should simply display appropriatly)
    - selectable text should not be cut by selection (eg. title)
    - double click on empty space in todo should not result in edit

  Alterations
    - several "o-" classes have been added for targetting; since everything
      needs to work even when the context is not persistent. How the context
      achieves persistence is also irrelevant (routing is simply an option)
    - data-singular, data-plural inserted to show basic translation approuch;
      this will not work under all circumstances (eg. if you have two variables
      in the translation this approuch will not work; for really complex 
      translations you can simply compile them and make a request to the server)
